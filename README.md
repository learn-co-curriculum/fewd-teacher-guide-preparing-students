## Objectives

* Provide students an overview of the content ahead and present the Flatiron School’s “Learn IDE” prior to the first day

### Key Take-Aways

Students will have a stateful, network-uplink-required cloud-based development solution. This “lab” can be considered and taught to be the students’ scratch space. They can store their own web pages in progress here. The terminal features a command `httpserver` which launches a small WEBrick server in the current working directory.

This means that as students desire to grow outside the curriculum / create their own web site, they can re-open this lab, at any point and continue work. Ideally, to make the most efficient use of the first day, students should have a learn.co account set up and have at least seen the Learn IDE.

### Considerations

The LearnIDE housekeeping can be a bit strange for those who have never worked with `git` or GitHub before. We’ve tried to take the sting out, but this housekeeping step is needed in order for Learn to keep track of progress. Without it Learn will nag students to complete the lab, create-a-custom-cloud-computer, until is detects a PR in their forked repo. Students might need help making sure they created the PR.
